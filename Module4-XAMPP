Module 4: Installing and Configuring XAMPP
This module will guide you through installing and configuring XAMPP, a local development environment that includes Apache, MySQL, and PHP. By the end of this module, you'll have a fully functional local web server to develop and test your WordPress site.

Section 4.1: Introduction to XAMPP
4.1.1: What is XAMPP?

XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB (formerly MySQL), and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages.
4.1.2: Benefits of Using XAMPP

Easy installation and configuration.
Includes all necessary components for local development.
Supports multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Ideal for testing and development purposes.
Section 4.2: Installing XAMPP
4.2.1: Downloading XAMPP

Go to the XAMPP download page.
Choose the version suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Click "Download" and save the installer to your computer.
4.2.2: Installing XAMPP on Windows

Run the XAMPP installer.
Follow the installation wizard steps.
Select the components you want to install (Apache, MySQL, PHP, phpMyAdmin, etc.).
Choose the installation directory (default is C:\xampp).
Complete the installation and launch the XAMPP Control Panel.
4.2.3: Installing XAMPP on macOS

Open the downloaded XAMPP .dmg file.
Drag the XAMPP folder to your Applications folder.
Open the XAMPP application and start the services from the control panel.
4.2.4: Installing XAMPP on Linux

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the XAMPP installer.
Make the installer executable:
sh
Copy code
sudo chmod +x xampp-linux-x64-x.x.x-0-installer.run
Run the installer:
sh
Copy code
sudo ./xampp-linux-x64-x.x.x-0-installer.run
Follow the installation wizard steps to complete the installation.
Section 4.3: Configuring XAMPP
4.3.1: Starting Apache and MySQL Services

Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
Start the Apache and MySQL services by clicking the "Start" buttons next to them.
Verify that the services are running by checking the status indicators.
4.3.2: Configuring phpMyAdmin

phpMyAdmin is a web-based interface for managing MySQL databases.
Access phpMyAdmin by navigating to http://localhost/phpmyadmin in your web browser.
Use the default username root with no password to log in.
4.3.3: Creating a MySQL Database

In phpMyAdmin, click on the "Databases" tab.
Enter a name for your new database and click "Create".
Your new database is now ready to be used.
4.3.4: Configuring Apache

The Apache configuration file is located at C:\xampp\apache\conf\httpd.conf on Windows and /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/etc/httpd.conf on macOS.
Open the configuration file in a text editor.
Common configurations include setting the DocumentRoot and configuring virtual hosts.
4.3.5: Setting Up Virtual Hosts

Virtual hosts allow you to run multiple websites on a single server.
Open the virtual hosts configuration file located at C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf on Windows and /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/etc/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf on macOS.
Add the following configuration to set up a virtual host:
apache
Copy code
<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/yourproject"
    ServerName yourproject.local
    <Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs/yourproject">
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
Edit your hosts file to map the virtual host name to localhost.
On Windows, open C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts in a text editor.
On macOS, open /etc/hosts in a text editor.
Add the following line:
plaintext
Copy code
127.0.0.1    yourproject.local
Section 4.4: Testing Your Local Web Server
4.4.1: Creating a Test PHP File

Navigate to your XAMPP htdocs directory (C:\xampp\htdocs on Windows or /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs on macOS).
Create a new file named test.php with the following content:
php
Copy code
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
Save the file and navigate to http://localhost/test.php in your web browser.
You should see the PHP information page, indicating that your local web server is working correctly.
4.4.2: Troubleshooting Common Issues

If Apache or MySQL fails to start, check the XAMPP Control Panel for error messages.
Common issues include port conflicts (make sure ports 80 and 443 are not being used by other applications) and incorrect configuration settings.
